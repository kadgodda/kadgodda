- 👋 Hi, I’m @kadgodda
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and data analytics.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning python, SQL, jupyter lab, and advancing my data transformation skills from spreadsheets (google sheets) to more capable languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that require data transformation using python and SQL preferrably in Jupyter Lab.
